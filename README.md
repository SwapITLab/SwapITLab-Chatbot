# SwapITLab Chatbot

The SwapITLab Chatbot is a modern web-based conversational interface that combines elegant design with practical functionality. This project offers a seamless chat experience with a professional appearance, featuring a clean, responsive interface with a deep blue color scheme that works beautifully across both desktop and mobile devices.

At its core, the chatbot implements a sophisticated architecture that handles real-time conversations, processes user input, and generates appropriate responses. What sets this chatbot apart is its training capabilities - users can add custom questions and answers through an intuitive training interface, allowing the chatbot to learn and adapt to specific use cases. The system uses a smart matching algorithm to find the most appropriate responses to user queries, ensuring relevant and contextual interactions.

The project emphasizes user experience through features like persistent chat history, auto-resizing input fields, and smooth animations. All data, including conversation history and training data, is stored locally, ensuring that the chatbot maintains its knowledge and conversation context between sessions. The interface includes convenient controls for clearing chat history and managing training data, making it easy for users to maintain and customize their chatbot experience.

With its combination of modern design, practical functionality, and customization options, the SwapITLab Chatbot serves as an excellent foundation for building interactive conversational interfaces that can be tailored to specific needs and use cases.

Training Mode:

The training mode in the SwapITLab Chatbot provides a user-friendly interface for customizing the chatbot's responses. When activated through a dedicated button, a modal window appears with a simple form containing two fields: one for entering expected user queries and another for the desired responses. Users can easily add new question-answer pairs using the "Add Training Data" button, and all added training data is displayed in a scrollable list below the form. The interface allows for easy management of training data, with the ability to remove individual items using a delete button, and all training data persists between sessions using local storage. When a user sends a message, the chatbot employs a similarity matching algorithm to compare the message against the trained questions, providing the corresponding trained answer if a match is found, or a default response asking for clarification if no match is available. This intuitive training system makes the chatbot highly customizable, enabling users to build a knowledge base specific to their needs without requiring technical expertise.
